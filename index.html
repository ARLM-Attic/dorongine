		<ul>
		<li>Simplified the initial phase of the game to be less overwhelming on first go, to try and lead people into the various bits and pieces. Still some work to go though - thanks to those who have given feedback around this!</li>
		<li>Added random process that will give a big boost boost or reduction in price for some items for a period of time</li>
		<li>Changed some of the types to be a little 'simpler' to get things going to avoid some of the pointless grind that could otherwise eventuate. Will be introducing some new elements around Crime and Pollution to counter this later on :)</li>
		<li>Mining consumption of Ore tweaked, removing the out-of-place 'Mine' button</li>
		<li>Changed batteries to be cheaper for getting Cash based energy, and replaced what they were with a Power Pack</li>
		<li>Added tidal power for power gen</li>
		<li>Reduced consumption and increased output of Nuclear power</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Still to come</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Better stats display</li>
		<li>Crime effects, countering buildings</li>
		<li>Deaths...</li>
		<li>Different building streams depending on how you're playing the game. ie Lots of Crime might mean thefts, murders etc, but you may have an option of buildings like strip clubs, drug dens etc...</li>
		</ul>
